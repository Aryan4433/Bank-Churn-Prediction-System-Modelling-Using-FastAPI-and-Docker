#🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction System — FastAPI & Docker

#The Bank Customer Churn Prediction System aims to accurately predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) in the near future. This enables proactive retention strategies, helping reduce churn rates and improve customer loyalty.

#A machine learning model is developed to predict customer attrition, integrated with a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit-based user interface for real-time interaction. The complete application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
